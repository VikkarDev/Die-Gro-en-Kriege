Die Großen Kriege is a Hearts of Iron 4 starting in the year 1900.
An all-encompassing mod of the 20th century, DGK will focus on the important wars and events that took place from 1900-1990, through the basis of the HOI4 Engine.

Our mod team will be initially developing from 1900-1918, and continuing to add new settings and start-dates as we finish the last.
Play as Germany with the Central Powers, or play as the German Reich with the Axis. Experience the Korean War, Vietnam War, and more. This mod will allow everyone to experience all sides of war from Asia, to Europe, and to America, as well as experiment with various and subtle differences caused by your actions.

Die Großen Kriege will also focus a-historical routes too. Play as the German Reich in early 1900. Reform the Tokugawa Shogunate and realise true imperial Bushido! You make the the history! We want to provide fun and knowledge to everyone who plays. We are creating a branching line of events, that allow even scripted peace deals and events to have flavour and choice.

You can turn off scripted peace deals, etc with the settings menu in our decisions tab.
This mod will try to provide most countries with a focus tree, events, and history. For now, our main priority is getting the important countries done in our first setting of 1900-1918

Die Großen Kriege will also not simply just be isolated start dates. With dynamic and updating focus trees, you will be able to play multi-decade games aligning to your historical or non historical choices.

We hope you enjoy the current development cycle and we hope to bring you an exceptional and well-polished HOI4 experience.
