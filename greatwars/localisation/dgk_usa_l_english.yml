# FOCUS TREE
########### 1900-1914 Focus Tree Localisation ###########
USA_gilded_age:0 "The Gilded Age"
USA_gilded_age_desc:0 "It is the golden age of the United States. With the reconstruction finally ending in the 1870's the USA could finally spread its wings and launch into the new century. At no time in history has the country experienced a period of more rapid economic growth and development than now. Fortunes are made, gambled, and lost in the span of a few years, and the boom has fueled innovation and the emergence of the first American global corporations. Things in the east are booming, as names like John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and J. P. Morgan rule the day. However, not all is as it seems on the surface..."
USA_jeffersons_vision:0 "Jefferson's Vision"
USA_jeffersons_vision_desc:0 "At the very founding of the United States there was a great disagreement about what the ideal American society would look like. Alexander Hamilton and his Federalist Party envisioned an America of industrial might, large cities, and great material wealth. On the contrary, men like Thomas Jefferson envisioned a nation of farmers—each man owning his own land, eating his own food, controlling his own destiny, and living together in harmony with others. It is clear that Hamilton's ideas have ruled the day, but at what cost? Only one thing can save this nation from itself—and that is a return to the America that Jefferson once had in mind."
USA_corporate_primacy:0 "Corporate Primacy"
USA_corporate_primacy_desc:0 "Who needs 'small businesses' when you have the option for even BIGGER businesses? Corporate power is what will propel the United States into first on the world stage. If a few farmers and shopkeepers get hurt along the way, so be it."
USA_continue_subsidies:0 "Continue the Subsidies"
USA_continue_subsidies_desc:0 "Since the early days of this country our government has always seen fit to help out various key industries in the nation, be it agricultural or industrial. Oftentimes this comes in the form of tariffs to protect national goods, but sometimes it also comes in the form of direct subsidies or contracts to businesses. If we want to sustain the rapid growth of our industry, the govenrment must step in and help out."
USA_favorable_business_reg:0 "Favorable Business Regulations"
USA_favorable_business_reg_desc:0 "If we want our businesses to continue to grow and prosper, we must make sure that we're cutting down on the bureaucratic red tape within our government. Businesses need a healthy market to thrive and grow in, and we must make sure to provide that."
USA_ignore_monopolization:0 "Ignore Monopolization"
USA_ignore_monopolization_desc:0 "Political economists have long lampooned the idea of a monopoly company in a market as 'anti-competative' and bad for business. While this may be true in their theories, it surely won't materialize in practice. Any monopolies which arise in our nation form simply because they're the best, and if we're getting our share of the profits, what harm can it do?"
USA_true_free_market:0 "A Truly Free Market"
USA_true_free_market_desc:0 "Despite the success of our businesses, one cannot turn a blind eye to the problem of monopolization in our markets. We cannot afford to have important industries like steel, coal, railroads, and oil controlled by a singular entity. The time has ccome to take a stand against these behemoths and put an end to their domination."
USA_enforce_sherman_act:0 "Enforce the Sherman Act"
USA_enforce_sherman_act_desc:0 "The Sherman Antitrust act of 1890 was the first federal law designed to prevent the formation of trusts—large conglomerations of businesses consolidated together for the purpose of promoting a unified policy over a market—but it has largely been ignored and unenforced by the government. The act provides us with the necessary tools to break up the trusts, but doing so would doubtless anger the magnates..."
USA_anti_monopoly_hearings:0 "Anti-Monopoly Hearings"
USA_anti_monopoly_hearings_desc:0 "Now that we've decided to embrace Congress' responsibility to dismantle monopolies under the Sherman Act we must hold hearings for various companies which fit the definitions of anticompetative under the act. With this, we can bring fair competition to our markets—or eliminate those who won't support us..."
USA_fair_competition:0 "Fair Competition"
USA_fair_competition_desc:0 "Now that the monopolies have been curtailed we can finally embrace the free market ideals that America was founded upon. We are truly a land of freedom, fairness, and opportunity."
USA_encourage_vertical_integration:0 "Encourage Vertical Integration"
USA_encourage_vertical_integration_desc:0 "The idea of 'free and fair competition' is highly overrated in this country. The government shouldn't be trying to hinder the practices of our lagre businesses—quite the opposite! We should instead encourage the consolidation of industrial sectors and we will all reap the profits."
USA_consolidate_sectors:0 "Consolidate Sectors"
USA_consolidate_sectors_desc:0 "As it is the role of the government to facilitate the national economy, it should also fall within our purview to manage certain sectors as the public good requires. Closer cooperation between businesses and government is needed, and introducing legislation to centralize some sectors will help this process along."
USA_sponsored_industrialization:0 "State-Sponsored Industrialization"
USA_sponsored_industrialization_desc:0 "If we wish to ever be on the economic level of the nations of Europe then the government must continue to take an active role in investing in the industrialization of our economy. We may be ahead in the race right now, but we must make sure the United States always remains on top of global manufacturing and production."
USA_continue_laissez_faire:0 "Continue "Laissez Faire""
USA_continue_laissez_faire_desc:0 "Our current economic policies of minimal intervention have given us great prosperity. Although we don't fully embrace the aforementioned idea of Adam Smith, the American System has shown to be successful and thus needs no change."
USA_continue_protectionism:0 "Continue Protectionist Policies"
USA_continue_protectionism_desc:0 "Protectionism has served as a cornerstone of the American economy nearly since its inception. It has facilitated the rapid growth of our domestic industry and protected from foreign dumping of goods. Tried and tested, this practice will continue to form the bedrock of our trade policy."
USA_gold_question:0 "The Gold Question"
USA_gold_question_desc:0 "There has recently been increasing skepticism thoughout the nation about the benefits of the Gold Standard—a system which has long laid at the very foundation of the US economy. Perhaps it is time we re-evaluate the benefits of such a system and open up to the arguments of the other side."
USA_gold_standard_act:0 "The Gold Standard Act"
USA_gold_standard_act_desc:0 "The introduction of the Gold Standard Act will give our nation the chance to say once and for all which path we choose for our financial future. Should the act succeed, we can expect more of the same, but it is uncertain what may happen should it fail..."
USA_gold_stay_course:0 "Stay the Course"
USA_gold_stay_course_desc:0 "The passage of the Gold Standard Act has once again solidified the financial policy of this nation. With a hard and stable backing to our currency we can continue our rapid growth and development."
USA_fiduciary_responsibility:0 "Fiduciary Responsibility"
USA_fiduciary_responsibility_desc:0 "There is no question that the upholding of the Gold Standard has ensured vigilance on the part of the govenrment dealing with finances. If we are to make sure our policies are sound, we must continue to place emphasis on fiduciary responsiblity. A sound currency makes for a sound economy!"
USA_central_banking_question:0 "The Question of Central Banking"
USA_central_banking_question_desc:0 "Ever since the Veto of the Second Bank of the United States by Andrew Jackson the country has proceeded without a centralized institution for lending, issuing credit, or treasury notes. However, we must carefully examine whether such a policy has been a good choice for our nation, and if not; take action to change course."
USA_bimetallism:0 "Bimetallism"
USA_bimetallism_desc:0 "The failure of the Gold Standard Act has cast doubt about the future of the dollar's backing. Fortunately, a solution has presented itself. Rather than a single metal—gold—acting as our backer, we shall have both gold and silver. This will allow the value of our dollar to depreciate just enough to satisfy the wants of businessmen in the east and farmers in the west."
USA_america_silver_slippers:0 "America's Silver Slippers"
USA_america_silver_slippers_desc:0 "With free silver now ruling the day, America can finally put her silver slippers on and the currency trouble behind us."
USA_devalue_dollar:0 "Devalue the Dollar"
USA_devalue_dollar_desc:0 "It's become a nightmare in this nation to be someone with debt! The Gold Standard kept the working class constantly trapped in a vicious cycle of deflation, with debt being nearly impossible to pay back. With it gone, we can finally give the dollar a much needed devaluation and allow economic prosperity to reach the lower classes."

USA.1.t:0 "Philippines Surrenders!"
USA.1.d:0 "The United States has scored another victory! After 3 years of fighting, the government of the Philippines announced its unconditional surrender to the government of the United States. While it seems like victory has been achieved, the region is not yet stable and the local populations are wary of the American liberators. We will need to sort out our policy in relationship to the occupation of the Philippines soon. But before we can do even that, we must defeat another military enemy, the Tagalog Republic. The Tagalog Republic was formed by the Katipunan, a Fillipino revolutionary movement which originally called for revolution against the Spanish colonial overlords, but now they oppose the American occupation. Despite the surrender of the Fillipino government, the fighting is by no means over."
USA.1.a:0 "Occupy them for some time."

USA_campaign_decisions.1.t:0 "Campaign in Texas is a Success!"
USA_campaign_decisions.1.d:0 "After [Root.GetLeader]’s recent campaign in Texas, polls have noticed a stark upturn in support for the presidential hopeful. Large crowds were seen attending rallies at Dallas and Houston, with [Root.GetLeader] crossing the state in his personal locomotive, in what seemed to be something out of a cowboy movie."

########### USA National Spirits Localisation ###########
USA_1900_us_election:0 "1900 US Election"
USA_1900_us_election_desc:0 ""
USA_jim_crow_laws:0 "Jim Crow Laws"
USA_jim_crow_laws_desc:0 "After the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction in the former Confederate States, southern lawmakers and local officials began to find increasingly creative ways to strip away the rights of former slaves and free African Americans who had been granted protections under the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments passed by Congress after the war. These laws are colloquially referred to as “Jim Crow laws” and became the basis for the institution of segregation in the United States. The recent Plessy v. Ferguson decision only further enforced such laws as constitutional, and provided for the doctrine of “Separate but Equal”. The decision by the Supreme Court virtually extinguished any hope of striking the Jim Crow laws in the near future, and it is unlikely that the status quo of segregation will be challenged without more radical change."
USA_scars_of_1865:0 "Scars of 1865"
USA_scars_of_1865_desc:0 "Although nearly half a century finished, the political fallout of the Civil War remains at the forefront of the social and economic life of many Americans. The brief period of reconstruction in the United States did do much to ensure that a second secession would be impossible, it did little to assuage the angers of many in the South about the loss in the war,  and furthermore did little to protect the rights of many African Americans who were freed after it. The Confederate Flag decision still flies, Jim Crow is still in effect, and nothing has been done to prevent education in the South from focusing around the idea of the ‘Lost Cause’. Those in the north may have moved on from the devastating conflict, the other half of the nation still lies mired in the same Confederate sentiment of old."
USA_the_gold_standard:0 "The Gold Standard"
USA_the_gold_standard_desc:0 "Since the founding of the United States the Gold Standard has remained a symbol of the unshakable financial system of the country. Through panics, recessions, depressions, and wars the Gold Standard has remained intact and has brought with it a stable currency and much economic growth—for the time being of course…"
american_imperialism:0 "American Imperialism"
american_imperialism_desc:0 "After nearly 100 years of isolationism from foreign affairs, the United States has finally emerged as a global power-broker on the world stage. The defeat of the weak Spanish Empire to seize Cuba and the Philippines only further supports our God-given obligation to dominate this hemisphere. It is truly the fulfillment of our Manifest Destiny."
USA_the_two_party_system:0 "The Two-Party System"
USA_the_two_party_system_desc:0 "Though the United States has been through some rough patches in its history, the country has remained—for the most part—an immensely stable democratic system, in no small part because of the two-party system. Unlike parliamentary democracy, the party system gives the unique advantage of an exxtra defense against the more extreme political viewpoints and allows policy to stay fairly consistent over time. Due to this entrenched establishment, it is very difficult for smaller and more extreme parties to gain prominence in the United States—that is without attaching their ideas to one of the ‘Big Two’..."
USA_fully_industrialized_society:0 "Fully-Industrialized Society"
USA_fully_industrialized_society_desc:0 "Although it may not have been the first nation to undergo an industrial revolution, there is perhaps nowhere in the world where industrialism has reached as great of an extent as it has in the United States. The nation is the global center of manufacturing, production, and innovation, with an economy rivaling that of the greatest European Powers."

USA_WILLIAM:0 "William McKinley"
USA_THEODORE_ROOSEVELT:0 "Theodore Roosevelt"
USA_THEODORE_NAME:0 "Theodore Roosevelt"
WILLIAM_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "William McKinley Jr, born and bred in rural Ohio entered this world into humble beginnings. Hailing from Irish immigrants, William's family were stout abolishionists, only furthered by William's conversion to Methodism when he was 16 years of age. A veteran of the civil war, William developed his republican ideals on the battlefield, idolising the likes of Lincoln. Beginning a career in politics almost as soon as the war ended, William ascended to the 17th Ohio congressional seat, turning down a potentially lucrative career in law. His strong campaigning skills and popular policies landed him as governer of Ohio in 1892, despite fierce opposition from Democrats with constant underhanded tactics working against him. He began silently planning his run for presidency in 1895, defeating his opponent, William Jennings Bryan, in which McKinley's view of a stronger central government building American industry through protective tariffs and a dollar based on gold triumphed. William has seemingly established a "Republican Dominance". With federal election looming, and economic success mild, questions are looming to whether William can hold onto the presidency. The hotbed and often fierce nature of modern politics has allowed William's consistant successes, even in war, to upshoot his public and political standing."
THEODORE_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "Though Theodore Roosevelt came from an affluent New York family, he was not always the imposing and bombastic man the American public knows and loves. A weak and sickly boy from birth to his teenage years, he grew found solace through intense exercise, eventually besting his childhood diseases and weak physique. Through his physical exertions he became a large and intense man, known for his exciting and animated way of speech. His skill as an orator along with help from his family connections landed him a seat at age 24, where he began his first political career. This initial promising start was cut short when on February 12 of 1884 his mother and wife died on the same day. Grief stricken, Roosevelt threw himself back into the only thing he knew—hard physical exertion. He ventured westward, where he discovered himself in the wild. Returning a different man, Roosevelt gained immense fame for his resignation as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1898 opting instead to see combat in the Spanish-American War. Hailed as the Hero of San Juan Hill upon his return, his career was propelled instantly as he immediately won the governorship of New York and then the Vice Presidential nomination the year afterward. With his rough demeanor and immense fame, Roosevelt commands the hearts and minds of nearly all Americans—embodying the spirit of the nation"
