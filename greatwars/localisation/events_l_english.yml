dgk_news.1.a:0 "Time for a stop in China."
dgk_news.1.b:0 "They can't stop us!"
dgk_news.2.t:0 "Peace in China"
dgk_news.2.d:0 "The war has ended! After a long fight, the Eight Nations have finally responded to Qing China and made peace. As of now, Russia will occupy Manchuria. Concessions will happen during this period, while Qing sits in defeat."
dgk_news.2.a:0 "Finally."
dgk_news.2.b:0 "We lost miserably."
dgk_news.3.t:0 "Russo-Japanese War"
dgk_news.3.d:0 "War! The most powerful option in international politics. And it has been used again - this time by the growing “rising sun” of the east, Japan, to declare war on the Russian Empire. While the move may surprise those who have not been following the events in the Far East, many experts on geopolitics say that the war was made inevitable by Russian imperial ambitions in Manchuria and conflicts of interest following the defeat of the Boxer Rebellion.\n\n They have also argued that it was not truly an act of Japanese aggression, but a preemptive strike by Japan intended to use the element of surprise to their advantage. And the start of the war was indeed surprising for the Russians, who were attacked by the Japanese navy before the declaration of war had even been received."
dgk_news.3.a:0 "Okay."
dgk_news.3.b:0 "We will fight!"

dgk_generic.7.a:0 "We'll resolve this in some way."

# JAPAN
japan.1.t:0 "Navy Pressure to Emperor About Manchuria"
japan.1.d:0 "As Russian ambitions in the Japanese sphere of influence grow, the navy has suggested that the Empire makes a preemptive strike against the Tsar, as to utilize the element of surprise against the damned Ruskies. While there has been a great deal of bickering between the navy and the army, it is ultimately up to the Emperor himself to decide. A decision that could very much affect the future of the Empire is on the emperor’s desk. Ultimately, he decided to…"
japan.1.a:0 "Declare war immediately. We must strike first!"
japan.1.b:0 "Wait for the Russians. If they want a fight, we will fight, but not otherwise."
japan.3.t:0 "Russian Empire Surrenders"
japan.3.d:0 "After a series of battles in the Liaodong Peninsula resulting in Russian armies being driven from southern Manchiria, and the the Battle of Tsushima had a resulted in a cataclysm for the Imperial Russin Navy, the Russo-Japanese can finally come to an end if you accept Russia's surrender."
japan.3.a:0 "We won, lets accept their surrender."
japan.3.b:0 "The war isn't over yet. Keep fighting!"
japan.4.t:0 "The Manchurian Crisis"
japan.4.d:0 "Manchuria was denied from us once in 1888. Right now, the Russians are attempting their own hegenomy of the region simply unopposed. China has bent the knee to Russian railway manufacturers, and Port Arther is lucratively leased to them. The Chinese lapdogs are no matter to us. Our current military command are at a crossroads. Some, are extremely hesitant. Russia's Pacific Fleet alone outnumbers our surface fleet by multiple capital ships, and Russian ground forces in Manchuria number in the hundreds of thousands. A war it this stage would be idiotic.\n\nHowever, some, including Meiji himself believe that with proper positioning, planning, and through the Samurai spirit, we can defeat the Russian barbarians and push for peace with swift victories. Furthermore, our people itch for a war, with overwhelming support for proving our might in the field, and establishing ourselves as a true dominant power in Asia, which could feasibly be achieved with this opportunity for war."
japan.4.a:0 "Manchuria will be ours."
japan.5.t:0 "Japan Issues Diplomatic Protest!"
japan.5.d:0 "The fledgling state of Japan been attempting their own Asian hegenomy for some time now. Our overlapping claims in Northern China has never really been much of a concern to us. However, Japan seems content in escalating the situation and has issued a protest to our troops rightfully occupying our vital railways in the region. This could easily transform into a dangerious sitation for us, and potentially cause a war in our far east holdings. This would not be ideal, our incomplete infrastructure network and sub-par rail network would greatly hamper any war effort in the region. Japan also fields a powerful navy, one to even challenge ours held at Port Arthur."
japan.5.a:0 "We cannot risk a war!"
japan.5.b:0 "How about maybe YOU chill?!"
japan.6.t:0 "Japanese Cooperation?"
japan.6.d:0 "The Japanese embassy has made an interesting diplomatic move recently. A join mutual alliance, with secret intent to move against Russia. Russian expansion in the East, according to the Japanese ambassador has been "threatening Japanese sovereignty" and is in clear violation of previous treatys they have formed with China. Should we accept, Japan would be free to intervene in Russian expansion, a potentially benificial situation for us in the European balance game."
japan.6.a:0 "Sign the Treaty, Russian Expansion must be stopped."
japan.6.b:0 "We have no time for frivolous Asian affairs."
japan.7.t:0 "Lines Drawn in the Sand"
japan.7.d:0 "With Russia accepting our Korean claim and pulling out of Manchuria, We can now freely decide the fate of the territories we rightfully claim. The Qing government expects us to return lost territories to them, simply accepting our claim in Korea. However, the weak and destitute Qing state would do little to stop Annexations of Port Arthur. Furthurmore, there are those in China who are willing to cooperate with us, with promise of overthrowing the Qing government. This could present an opportunity for a Chinese puppet."
japan.7.a:0 "Simply enforce our rule in Korea."
japan.7.b:0 "Claim Port Arthur."
japan.7.c:0 "Annex the whole region."
japan.8.t:0 "Japan Wishes for Non-Aggression Pact"
japan.8.d:0 "It seems the Japanese nation in light of recent defeats are seeking for a safeguarded peace withour nation, citing a "dangerous and costly development in China" Japan has also taken the opportunity to build up its military presence in Korea as well as develop their military industry, so it might be wise to go along with their plan."
japan.9.a:0 "We do not seek further war with Japan."
japan.9.b:0 "A non agression pact is not within our best interest at the moment."

# UNITED KINGDOM
united_kingdom.1.t:0 "British Victory!"
united_kingdom.1.d:0 "The Second Boer War, having been fought between the British Empire and the Boer nations of South Africa and the Orange Free State since 1899, has finally come to an end. As expected by many, the British Empire has emerged triumphant and the Boers have been crushed.\n\nThe peace agreement signed in Pretoria will bring the former Boer states under British authority. And while amongst those knowledgeable about the situation, there is no doubt that there will be further ethnic tensions in the region, but for now, peace has arrived in South Africa."
united_kingdom.1.a:0 "Occupy them for a few years."

# USA
USA.1.t:0 "Philippines Surrenders!"
USA.1.d:0 "The United States has scored another victory! After 3 years of fighting, the government of the Philippines announced its unconditional surrender to the government of the United States. While it seems like victory has been achieved, the region is not yet stable and the local populations are wary of the American liberators. We will need to sort out our policy in relationship to the occupation of the Philippines soon. But before we can do even that, we must defeat another military enemy, the Tagalog Republic. The Tagalog Republic was formed by the Katipunan, a Fillipino revolutionary movement which originally called for revolution against the Spanish colonial overlords, but now they oppose the American occupation. Despite the surrender of the Fillipino government, the fighting is by no means over."
USA.1.a:0 "Occupy them for some time."
USA_campaign_decisions.1.t:0 "Campaign in Texas is a Success!"
USA_campaign_decisions.1.d:0 "After [Root.GetLeader]’s recent campaign in Texas, polls have noticed a stark upturn in support for the presidential hopeful. Large crowds were seen attending rallies at Dallas and Houston, with [Root.GetLeader] crossing the state in his personal locomotive, in what seemed to be something out of a cowboy movie."
USA_campaign_decisions.1.a:0 "We're one step closer to winning."
