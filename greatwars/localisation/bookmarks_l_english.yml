GER_SILENT_NIGHT_DESC:0 "With the dawn of Germany in 1871 from Prussia, Wilhelm II came into power. Following this, he has brought up the economy and built an army.\n\nWith tensions growing in Europe however, they ally with the Austro-Hungarian Empire against the East and West."
TUR_SILENT_NIGHT_DESC:0 "The Ottoman Empire once a glorious empire now not even a shard of its former glory. With most of its regions bidding for independance from the Ottomans one can only wander how long they can survive."

HUN_SILENT_NIGHT_DESC:0 "Since the proclamation of Austria to Austria Hungary on  June 8, 1867 the other minorities have begun to feel left out and angry.

# TURN OF THE CENTURY
TURN_OF_THE_CENTURY_NAME:0 "Turn of the Century"
TURN_OF_THE_CENTURY_DESC:0 "World tensions rise as Germany begins to be more French and British phobic, the Ottoman Empire quickly destabilizes, Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary is shot and killed in Serbia, and rising tensions from Europe wanting to show dominance is increasing. Now one wrong move from anyone will cause a Europe Wide War, perhaps a World Wide War..."
GER_TURN_OF_THE_CENTURY_DESC:0 "The German Empire, led by Kaiser Wilhelm II, is one of the strongest forces in Europe, allied with Austria-Hungary. Recently united by the Iron Chancellor Bismark, the Empire has a strong industrial base combined with militarism. Its power has increased rapidly during recent years, and there is popular enthusiasm for war - many are confident in the Kaiser's army, which is well-equipped and rated as the strongest ground force. United Kingdom and France, who have been the dominant power in Europe for long, fear expanding German power, while Germany itself seeks its rightful place in the sun."
HUN_TURN_OF_THE_CENTURY_DESC:0 "The Austro-Hungarian Empire, led by Franz Joseph I, is an aging power allied with the German Empire. Unlike Germany, it remains mostly backwards - it is yet to grow an industrial base and remains mostly agrarian. Once, the Hapsburg family could challenge anyone; now, it is a mix of instability from ethnic conflicts caused by the rise of nationalism in Europe. The Empire is going through a tumultuous time, and many question whether the Empire can stay in one piece. The Balkan threat looms over the Empire, and the military is largely disorganized and in need of modernization."
ENG_TURN_OF_THE_CENTURY_DESC:0 "The United Kingdom, led by King George V, is a vast empire with holdings in six of the seven continents, giving rise to the phrase "The sun never sets on the British Empire". It was the first European power to industrialize, and combined with its vast colonial resources, it is one of the richest and most resourceful countries. The people have faith in the British naval war machine, but as with most empires, it now struggles with ethnic conflicts. The jewel of the crown, or remnants of the Mughal Empire, resists against the unfair colonization - but the German threat has a higher priority."
