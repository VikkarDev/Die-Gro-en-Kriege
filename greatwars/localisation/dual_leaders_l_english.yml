CARL_VIKTOR_NAME:0 "Chlodwig Carl Viktor"
WILHELM_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "Wilhelm, ever since his inauguration in 1888 has had extremely large boots to fill. His dismissal of Bismarck in 1890, and subsequent "new course" plan set forth the dominoes that led to Germany becoming isolated in this new European environment. Attempting to emulate the successes Bismarck found in foreign relations, Wilhelm has managed only to prove himself a crass, arrogant militarist, often putting his foot in his mouth due to his erratic behaviour. However, Wilhelm's wit and intellect in military affairs is not to be questioned. He has taken advantage fully of the latest innovations in military thought, and has pioneered Germany to become arguably the strongest single state in all of Europe. As the various power blocs emerge, this presents ever greater challenges for both Germany and Wilhelm."
VIKTOR_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "The Prince of Hohenlohe, the Chancellor of Germany, the Prime Minister of Prussia. Chlodwig Carl Viktor is a man of many titles, and he is a controversial man in German politics. On one hand, reformists and liberals appreciate his cautious reforms, such as the introduction of the Prussian Military Law, the Law on Associations, and the civil code of Germany. His political achievements are not, however, unanimously appreciated. Some view him as a man who is actively sabotaging the German Empire, and opposes the Kaiser Wilhelm II. Many, however, take neither view, and instead see him as just another face in German politics. And perhaps this is true. His power is, in the end, quite limited. He is powerless to prevent the naval arms race, the growing German imperialism, and he has hardly any say in the affairs of the German war machine. This man of many titles also has many colors."

USA_THEODORE_NAME:0 "Theodore Roosevelt"
WILLIAM_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "William McKinley Jr, born and bred in rural Ohio entered this world into humble beginnings. Hailing from Irish immigrants, William's family were stout abolishionists, only furthered by William's conversion to Methodism when he was 16 years of age. A veteran of the civil war, William developed his republican ideals on the battlefield, idolising the likes of Lincoln. Beginning a career in politics almost as soon as the war ended, William ascended to the 17th Ohio congressional seat, turning down a potentially lucrative career in law. His strong campaigning skills and popular policies landed him as governer of Ohio in 1892, despite fierce opposition from Democrats with constant underhanded tactics working against him. He began silently planning his run for presidency in 1895, defeating his opponent, William Jennings Bryan, in which McKinley's view of a stronger central government building American industry through protective tariffs and a dollar based on gold triumphed. William has seemingly established a "Rebuplican Dominance". With federal election looming, and economic success mild, questions are looming to whether William can hold onto the presidency. The hotbed and often fierce nature of modern politics has allowed William's consistant successes, even in war, to upshoot his public and political standing."
THEODORE_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "Though Theodore Roosevelt came from an affluent New York family, he was not always the imposing and bombastic man the American public knows and loves. A weak and sickly boy from birth to his teenage years, he grew found solace through intense exercise, eventually besting his childhood diseases and weak physique. Through his physical exertions he became a large and intense man, known for his exciting and animated way of speech. His skill as an orator along with help from his family connections landed him a seat at age 24, where he began his first political career. This initial promising start was cut short when on February 12 of 1884 his mother and wife died on the same day. Grief stricken, Roosevelt threw himself back into the only thing he knew—hard physical exertion. He ventured westward, where he discovered himself in the wild. Returning a different man, Roosevelt gained immense fame for his resignation as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1898 opting instead to see combat in the Spanish-American War. Hailed as the Hero of San Juan Hill upon his return, his career was propelled instantly as he immediately won the governorship of New York and then the Vice Presidential nomination the year afterward. With his rough demeanor and immense fame, Roosevelt commands the hearts and minds of nearly all Americans—embodying the spirit of the nation"
