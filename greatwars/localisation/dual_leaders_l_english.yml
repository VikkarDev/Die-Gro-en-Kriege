WILHELM_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "Wilhelm, ever since his inauguration in 1888 has had extremely large boots to fill. His dismissal of Bismarck in 1890, and subsequent "new course" plan set forth the dominoes that led to Germany becoming isolated in this new European environment. Attempting to emulate the successes Bismarck found in foreign relations, Wilhelm has managed only to prove himself a crass, arrogant militarist, often putting his foot in his mouth due to his erratic behaviour. However, Wilhelm's wit and intellect in military affairs is not to be questioned. He has taken advantage fully of the latest innovations in military thought, and has pioneered Germany to become arguably the strongest single state in all of Europe. As the various power blocs emerge, this presents ever greater challenges for both Germany and Wilhelm."
VIKTOR_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "The Prince of Hohenlohe, the Chancellor of Germany, the Prime Minister of Prussia. Chlodwig Carl Viktor is a man of many titles, and he is a controversial man in German politics. On one hand, reformists and liberals appreciate his cautious reforms, such as the introduction of the Prussian Military Law, the Law on Associations, and the civil code of Germany. His political achievements are not, however, unanimously appreciated. Some view him as a man who is actively sabotaging the German Empire, and opposes the Kaiser Wilhelm II. Many, however, take neither view, and instead see him as just another face in German politics. And perhaps this is true. His power is, in the end, quite limited. He is powerless to prevent the naval arms race, the growing German imperialism, and he has hardly any say in the affairs of the German war machine. This man of many titles also has many colors."
