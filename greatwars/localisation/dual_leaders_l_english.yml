WILHELM_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "William II, or Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albert II, was born on January 27, 1859. He was German kaiser and king of Prussia from 1888 to the end of World War I in 1918, known for his militaristic manner as well for his vacillating policies. Wilhelm was the eldest child of Prince Frederick III, and of Victoria, the eldest of Britain's Queen Victoria. In March 1890, Wilhelm drove Otto von Bismarck into resigning as chancellor. When World War I rolled around, it seemed like an attempt to save Austria-Hungary from collapse, but then was transformed into a world of conflict by Germany. During the war, although nominally supreme commander, Wilhelm did not attempt to resist his generals when they kept its conduct in their own hands. He encouraged, instead of challenging, the grandiose war aims of the generals and many politicians that ruled out all chance of a compromise peace."
VIKTOR_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "The Prince of Hohenlohe, the Chancellor of Germany, the Prime Minister of Prussia. Chlodwig Carl Viktor is a man of many titles, and he is a controversial man in German politics. On one hand, reformists and liberals appreciate his cautious reforms, such as the introduction of the Prussian Military Law, the Law on Associations, and the civil code of Germany. His political achievements are not, however, unanimously appreciated. Some view him as a man who is actively sabotaging the German Empire, and opposes the Kaiser Wilhelm II. Many, however, take neither view, and instead see him as just another face in German politics. And perhaps this is true. His power is, in the end, quite limited. He is powerless to prevent the naval arms race, the growing German imperialism, and he has hardly any say in the affairs of the German war machine. This man of many titles also has many colors."
