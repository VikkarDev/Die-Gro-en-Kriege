CARL_VIKTOR_NAME:0 "Chlodwig Carl Viktor"
WILHELM_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "Wilhelm, ever since his inauguration in 1888 has had extremely large boots to fill. His dismissal of Bismarck in 1890, and subsequent "new course" plan set forth the dominoes that led to Germany becoming isolated in this new European environment. Attempting to emulate the successes Bismarck found in foreign relations, Wilhelm has managed only to prove himself a crass, arrogant militarist, often putting his foot in his mouth due to his erratic behaviour. However, Wilhelm's wit and intellect in military affairs is not to be questioned. He has taken advantage fully of the latest innovations in military thought, and has pioneered Germany to become arguably the strongest single state in all of Europe. As the various power blocs emerge, this presents ever greater challenges for both Germany and Wilhelm."
VIKTOR_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "The Prince of Hohenlohe, the Chancellor of Germany, the Prime Minister of Prussia. Chlodwig Carl Viktor is a man of many titles, and he is a controversial man in German politics. On one hand, reformists and liberals appreciate his cautious reforms, such as the introduction of the Prussian Military Law, the Law on Associations, and the civil code of Germany. His political achievements are not, however, unanimously appreciated. Some view him as a man who is actively sabotaging the German Empire, and opposes the Kaiser Wilhelm II. Many, however, take neither view, and instead see him as just another face in German politics. And perhaps this is true. His power is, in the end, quite limited. He is powerless to prevent the naval arms race, the growing German imperialism, and he has hardly any say in the affairs of the German war machine. This man of many titles also has many colors."

USA_THEODORE_NAME:0 "Theodore Roosevelt"
WILLIAM_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "William McKinley Jr, born and bred in rural Ohio entered this world into humble beginnings. Hailing from Irish immigrants, William's family were stout abolishionists, only furthered by William's conversion to Methodism when he was 16 years of age. A veteran of the civil war, William developed his republican ideals on the battlefield, idolising the likes of Lincoln. Beginning a career in politics almost as soon as the war ended, William ascended to the 17th Ohio congressional seat, turning down a potentially lucrative career in law. His strong campaigning skills and popular policies landed him as governer of Ohio in 1892, despite fierce opposition from Democrats with constant underhanded tactics working against him. He began silently planning his run for presidency in 1895, defeating his opponent, William Jennings Bryan, in which McKinley's view of a stronger central government building American industry through protective tariffs and a dollar based on gold triumphed. William has seemingly established a "Republican Dominance". With federal election looming, and economic success mild, questions are looming to whether William can hold onto the presidency. The hotbed and often fierce nature of modern politics has allowed William's consistant successes, even in war, to upshoot his public and political standing."
THEODORE_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "Though Theodore Roosevelt came from an affluent New York family, he was not always the imposing and bombastic man the American public knows and loves. A weak and sickly boy from birth to his teenage years, he grew found solace through intense exercise, eventually besting his childhood diseases and weak physique. Through his physical exertions he became a large and intense man, known for his exciting and animated way of speech. His skill as an orator along with help from his family connections landed him a seat at age 24, where he began his first political career. This initial promising start was cut short when on February 12 of 1884 his mother and wife died on the same day. Grief stricken, Roosevelt threw himself back into the only thing he knew—hard physical exertion. He ventured westward, where he discovered himself in the wild. Returning a different man, Roosevelt gained immense fame for his resignation as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1898 opting instead to see combat in the Spanish-American War. Hailed as the Hero of San Juan Hill upon his return, his career was propelled instantly as he immediately won the governorship of New York and then the Vice Presidential nomination the year afterward. With his rough demeanor and immense fame, Roosevelt commands the hearts and minds of nearly all Americans—embodying the spirit of the nation"

JAP_HOG_TITLE:0 "Shushō"

JAP_MEIJI:0 "Mutsuhito"
JAP_HIROBUMI_NAME:0 "Hirobumi Ito"
MEIJI_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "Mutsuhito is only a term found on paper and spoken by foreign lips. In Japan, it is Meiji, better known as Meiji the Great. The great reformer of the land, Meiji has seen what was an isolated medieval country transformed into an industrial powerhouse that has firmly placed itself at the top of the Asian pecking order. For hundreds of years however, the Emperor would not be the person you would see causing change or facilitating its creation. This role was given to the Shogun. The Emperor did not have the power, influence, or army to do much more than even step outside of the grand palace. Meiji found himself at an opportune time, being born in 1852, only a year before Japan was strongarmed by Matthew Perry into opening the country to foreigners. More a cause of situation rather than action, the young Mutsuhito saw constant conflict as Japan engulfed itself in destructive civil war as Daimyos and local lords fought eachother for ideological primacy and the overthrow of an ever-incompetant Shogunate. The next in line for the Imperial throne, Mutsuhito was ordaned into the Meiji era in 1867 at the age of 16 to the Chrysanthemum throne. Just one year later, seeking to restore what was a patchwork government after vast power vacuums had formed following the overthrow of the Shogunate, Meiji proclamed the grand restoration, later known as the Meiji Restoration, restoring power back into the hands of the Emperor, with an elected constitutional government taking the role of what once was the Daimyos. Physically enscribing notes from western style parliaments, the Meiji Constitution has seen the rapid bureaucratic, industrial, logistical and social development of Japan into something strikingly uncanny to any western nation, with a well-equipped army to boot. With the day-to-day governing largely returned to the hands of the Parliament, Meiji has largely returned to the role of a figurehead. However, there remains no doubt to the theoretical power that he holds, written firmly in the Meiji constitution."
HIROBUMI_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "Hirobumi Ito is a career politician through and through. The first, sixth, eightth and now eleventh prime minister of Japan, Hirobumi has so far served for 7 years as Japan's Prime Minister. For context, the Prime Ministerial role has only existed for 14 years. Hirobumi was born into a prominent samurai clan in 1841, when Japan was still feudally ruled by lords and warriors. Being only a boy when Japan opened itself to the outside world, Hirobumi became fascinated with European culture as well as how Japan relates to the world around it. He attended University in London, learning English, but most importantly learning of the western constitutions and systems of government. Being highly educated, Hirobumi was prime candidate for ministerial positions when the Meiji restoration rolled around in 1868. He was appointed governor of Hyogo Prefecture the same year as well as the role of a junior councillor for foreign affairs. Striking his name on every position ballot, Hirobumi pushed for a further study of western systems, as well as an aggressive and strong foreign policy despite his low ranking positions at the time. Visiting many foreign countries in his early years, Hirobumi climbed the ranks of the early Meiji government, and eventually found himself as the chairman of the Bureau of the Constitution, which penned the official Meiji Constitution. His time overseas served him greatly, and he used his knowledge of foreign governments, notably German, British and French, to model an entirely new system of governance, with Meiji as the sole head and ruler of Japan as is fitting, with him, as its first Prime Minister in 1885. Ambitious as it comes, Hirobumi saw many conflicts involving Japan, especially pushing for the heavily favourable treaty between Japan and China after the first Sjno-Japanese war. With Hirobumi serving his fourth term, only time will tell if his generally ambitious and dominating plans will bear fruit once again."

NICHOLAS_II_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "Nicholas II, the Emperor of All Russia, and of all the Russians. The sixth Tzar of the house of Romanov, Nicholas' bloodline is of pomp, circumstance and illustrious honors. Ruling since 1894 after his father Alexander's death, Nicholas has christened his reign with a stout devotion to his duties and the orthodox church. Crowned a saint, and known as the Passion-Bearer, Nicholas' reverement in the church seems to be the strongest unifying factor for his people. A traditional man, many times has Constitution been suggested, and many times has his absolute rule been enforced. Wishing for nothing more than the continuation of greater Russia, Nicholas is hell bent on keeping things orderly, with little time for fanciful affairs and more time for his family and his duties, Nicholas has done little to step outside the perverbial box of ruling enactment. However, the Tzar is notably plagued with bad omen. During his coronation celebration, over one thousand Moscow Citizens were trampled, with another thousand injured due to fears of lack of food. Even on trips to visit western Europe, Nicholas repeatedly suffered from headaches, toothaches and illnesses, a sign apparently of bad relations, or something more sinister to come. So far, the focus of Nicholas is the economy. The Trans-Siberian railway is one of the largest logistical and industrial projects for Russia to date, and the enactment of the gold-standard in 1897 saw what was the idea of a firm and stable Russian economy. So far uneventful and uninspiring, it looks to be Nicholas' reign will be one without disturbance and one without distribution. If it wasn't only for the consistent bad omens and misfortune plaguing his rule, it would seem everything is going fine..."

His father, Alfonso XII, had died just a year earlier in Novemember 1985. Under his mother's regency Alfonso has seen the hold Spain had over Asia and America disappear after Spain's humiliating defeat in the Spanish-American war of 1898, losing Spain's rule over Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines to the United States, forcing Alfonso and the Primer Ministro to focus development on Spain and whatever small colonies Spain has in Africa."
