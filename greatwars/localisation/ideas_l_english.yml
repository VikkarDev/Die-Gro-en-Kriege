german_colonies_desc:0 "The Deutsches Kolonialreich constitued the overseas colonies, dependencies and territories of Imperial Germany. The established merchants and plantation operators in the African colonies frequently managed to sway government policies. Capital investments by banks were secured with public funds of the imperial treasury to minimize risk. While the French and the English instituted policies that spread their languages and culture, Germany restricted use of German to a small number of elite colonial subjects. Colonies were regarded as overspill for German settlers, rather than as territories to be developed and eventually granted autonomy, or independence."

naval_arms_race_desc:0 "The arms race between Great Britain and Germany that occured from the last decade of the ninteeth century was one of the intertwined causes of World War I. While a bilateral relationship that had worsened over many decades, the arms race began with a plan by German Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz in 1897 to create a fleet in being to force Britain to make diplomatic concessions; Tirpitz did not expect the Imperial German Navy to defeat the Royal Navy. With the support of Wilhelm II, Tirpitz began passing a series of laws to construct an increasing number of large surface warships. This construction made the HMS Dreadnought in 1906. Tirpitz further increased the rate of naval construction."

jim_crow_laws:0 "Jim Crow Laws"
jim_crow_laws_desc:0 "After the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction in the former Confederate States, southern lawmakers and local officials began to find increasingly creative ways to strip away the rights of former slaves and free African Americans who had been granted protections under the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments passed by Congress after the war. These laws are colloquially referred to as “Jim Crow laws” and became the basis for the institution of segregation in the United States. The recent Plessy v. Ferguson decision only further enforced such laws as constitutional, and provided for the doctrine of “Separate but Equal”. The decision by the Supreme Court virtually extinguished any hope of striking the Jim Crow laws in the near future, and it is unlikely that the status quo of segregation will be challenged without more radical change."
scars_of_1865:0 "Scars of 1865"
scars_of_1865_desc:0 "Although nearly half a century finished, the political fallout of the Civil War remains at the forefront of the social and economic life of many Americans. The brief period of reconstruction in the United States did do much to ensure that a second secession would be impossible, it did little to assuage the angers of many in the South about the loss in the war,  and furthermore did little to protect the rights of many African Americans who were freed after it. The Confederate Flag decision still flies, Jim Crow is still in effect, and nothing has been done to prevent education in the South from focusing around the idea of the ‘Lost Cause’. Those in the north may have moved on from the devastating conflict, the other half of the nation still lies mired in the same Confederate sentiment of old."

american_imperialism_desc:0 "After nearly 100 years of isolationism from foreign affairs, the United States has finally emerged as a global power-broker on the world stage. The defeat of the weak Spanish Empire to seize Cuba and the Philippines only further supports our God-given obligation to dominate this hemisphere. It is truly the fulfillment of our Manifest Destiny."
the_two_party_system:0 "The Two-Party System"
the_two_party_system_desc:0 "Though the United States has been through some rough patches in its history, the country has remained—for the most part—an immensely stable democratic system, in no small part because of the two-party system. Unlike parliamentary democracy, the party system gives the unique advantage of an exxtra defense against the more extreme political viewpoints and allows policy to stay fairly consistent over time. Due to this entrenched establishment, it is very difficult for smaller and more extreme parties to gain prominence in the United States—that is without attaching their ideas to one of the ‘Big Two’..."

The nation is the global center of manufacturing, production, and innovation, with an economy rivaling that of the greatest European Powers."

Japan is now set on a course of a nationalistic and powerful central government, headed by a lineage of men descended from the sun god himself. Some mock or critise us for the absolute powers he holds, but is it not the roots of the Western powers that seeded the idea of absolute monarchy?

On the modern stage, it gives her soldiers a sense of fanaticism, the ability to throw themselves into the fray without any sense of hesitation."

Japan since, has rapidly industrialised the likes of which no other eastern country has seen before."

Our engineerial thought still reflects this, with tradition taking precedense over modernisation. We are yet to take advantage of brick or concrete, and our construction ability reflects this."

Instead of sheer firepower and force, Japan can rely on a supreme spirit and will of her sailors, and the conviction of the commanders that guide them."
