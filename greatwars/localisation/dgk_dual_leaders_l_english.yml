NICHOLAS_II_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "Nicholas II, the Emperor of All Russia, and of all the Russians. The sixth Tzar of the house of Romanov, Nicholas' bloodline is of pomp, circumstance and illustrious honors. Ruling since 1894 after his father Alexander's death, Nicholas has christened his reign with a stout devotion to his duties and the orthodox church. Crowned a saint, and known as the Passion-Bearer, Nicholas' reverement in the church seems to be the strongest unifying factor for his people. A traditional man, many times has Constitution been suggested, and many times has his absolute rule been enforced. Wishing for nothing more than the continuation of greater Russia, Nicholas is hell bent on keeping things orderly, with little time for fanciful affairs and more time for his family and his duties, Nicholas has done little to step outside the perverbial box of ruling enactment. However, the Tzar is notably plagued with bad omen. During his coronation celebration, over one thousand Moscow Citizens were trampled, with another thousand injured due to fears of lack of food. Even on trips to visit western Europe, Nicholas repeatedly suffered from headaches, toothaches and illnesses, a sign apparently of bad relations, or something more sinister to come. So far, the focus of Nicholas is the economy. The Trans-Siberian railway is one of the largest logistical and industrial projects for Russia to date, and the enactment of the gold-standard in 1897 saw what was the idea of a firm and stable Russian economy. So far uneventful and uninspiring, it looks to be Nicholas' reign will be one without disturbance and one without distribution. If it wasn't only for the consistent bad omens and misfortune plaguing his rule, it would seem everything is going fine..."

His father, Alfonso XII, had died just a year earlier in Novemember 1985. Under his mother's regency Alfonso has seen the hold Spain had over Asia and America disappear after Spain's humiliating defeat in the Spanish-American war of 1898, losing Spain's rule over Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines to the United States, forcing Alfonso and the Primer Ministro to focus development on Spain and whatever small colonies Spain has in Africa."
