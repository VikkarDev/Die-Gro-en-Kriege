JAP_MEIJI:0 "Mutsuhito"
JAP_HIROBUMI_NAME:0 "Hirobumi Ito"
JAP_YAMAGATA_NAME:0 "Yamagata Aritomo"
MEIJI_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "Mutsuhito is only a term found on paper and spoken by foreign lips. In Japan, it is Meiji, better known as Meiji the Great. The great reformer of the land, Meiji has seen what was an isolated medieval country transformed into an industrial powerhouse that has firmly placed itself at the top of the Asian pecking order. For hundreds of years however, the Emperor would not be the person you would see causing change or facilitating its creation. This role was given to the Shogun. The Emperor did not have the power, influence, or army to do much more than even step outside of the grand palace. Meiji found himself at an opportune time, being born in 1852, only a year before Japan was strongarmed by Matthew Perry into opening the country to foreigners. More a cause of situation rather than action, the young Mutsuhito saw constant conflict as Japan engulfed itself in destructive civil war as Daimyos and local lords fought eachother for ideological primacy and the overthrow of an ever-incompetant Shogunate. The next in line for the Imperial throne, Mutsuhito was ordaned into the Meiji era in 1867 at the age of 16 to the Chrysanthemum throne. Just one year later, seeking to restore what was a patchwork government after vast power vacuums had formed following the overthrow of the Shogunate, Meiji proclamed the grand restoration, later known as the Meiji Restoration, restoring power back into the hands of the Emperor, with an elected constitutional government taking the role of what once was the Daimyos. Physically enscribing notes from western style parliaments, the Meiji Constitution has seen the rapid bureaucratic, industrial, logistical and social development of Japan into something strikingly uncanny to any western nation, with a well-equipped army to boot. With the day-to-day governing largely returned to the hands of the Parliament, Meiji has largely returned to the role of a figurehead. However, there remains no doubt to the theoretical power that he holds, written firmly in the Meiji constitution."
HIROBUMI_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "Hirobumi Ito is a career politician through and through. The first, sixth, eightth and now eleventh prime minister of Japan, Hirobumi has so far served for 7 years as Japan's Prime Minister. For context, the Prime Ministerial role has only existed for 14 years. Hirobumi was born into a prominent samurai clan in 1841, when Japan was still feudally ruled by lords and warriors. Being only a boy when Japan opened itself to the outside world, Hirobumi became fascinated with European culture as well as how Japan relates to the world around it. He attended University in London, learning English, but most importantly learning of the western constitutions and systems of government. Being highly educated, Hirobumi was prime candidate for ministerial positions when the Meiji restoration rolled around in 1868. He was appointed governor of Hyogo Prefecture the same year as well as the role of a junior councillor for foreign affairs. Striking his name on every position ballot, Hirobumi pushed for a further study of western systems, as well as an aggressive and strong foreign policy despite his low ranking positions at the time. Visiting many foreign countries in his early years, Hirobumi climbed the ranks of the early Meiji government, and eventually found himself as the chairman of the Bureau of the Constitution, which penned the official Meiji Constitution. His time overseas served him greatly, and he used his knowledge of foreign governments, notably German, British and French, to model an entirely new system of governance, with Meiji as the sole head and ruler of Japan as is fitting, with him, as its first Prime Minister in 1885. Ambitious as it comes, Hirobumi saw many conflicts involving Japan, especially pushing for the heavily favourable treaty between Japan and China after the first Sjno-Japanese war. With Hirobumi serving his fourth term, only time will tell if his generally ambitious and dominating plans will bear fruit once again."
YAMAGATA_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "Being a prominent member of the Genro, the ruling elite during the Meiji restoration, Yamagata is a man that commands high respect from his peers. A key player in the crushing of the Satsuma rebellion, and staunch supporter of Meiji, Yamagata’s political pandering and subsequent connections garnered him a place at the top when Japan ultimately united under Meiji. Yamagata’s samurai lineage however did little to help his position, as his clan was plagued with low-standing and little respect from fellow clans. It was purely by his political positionings that worked to his advantage. Yamagata was an early member in the underground movement to overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate, and thus used the Imperial victories to weave his place in political positions. Being selected as one of the first members of Japanese politics to study foreign militaries, Yamagata learned valuable lessons about war doctrine. He became what was known as the ruling military elite. Often, in Japan, men of high military rank would also occupy high ranking political positions, further leading to the militarisation of the Japanese society. Yamagata’s talent for military affairs granted him a large following of officers, and he used this following to occupy many diverse and elite political positions throughout the 1880s and 1890s. Ministerial, legislative, and presidential positions are all under Yamagata’s belt, as well as previous experience as Prime Minister. Arguably the most powerful man in Japan, bar only Meiji himself, Yamagata is destined for continued successes. This does not mean he is without rivals, but his extreme respect, honour, and militarised position means his power is relatively safe. Some argue that a man of the military leading Japan will lead it down the path of war, Yamagata argues that this is simply the way of Japan, and has been for hundreds of years."

NICHOLAS_II_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "Nicholas II, the Emperor of All Russia, and of all the Russians. The sixth Tzar of the house of Romanov, Nicholas' bloodline is of pomp, circumstance and illustrious honors. Ruling since 1894 after his father Alexander's death, Nicholas has christened his reign with a stout devotion to his duties and the orthodox church. Crowned a saint, and known as the Passion-Bearer, Nicholas' reverement in the church seems to be the strongest unifying factor for his people. A traditional man, many times has Constitution been suggested, and many times has his absolute rule been enforced. Wishing for nothing more than the continuation of greater Russia, Nicholas is hell bent on keeping things orderly, with little time for fanciful affairs and more time for his family and his duties, Nicholas has done little to step outside the perverbial box of ruling enactment. However, the Tzar is notably plagued with bad omen. During his coronation celebration, over one thousand Moscow Citizens were trampled, with another thousand injured due to fears of lack of food. Even on trips to visit western Europe, Nicholas repeatedly suffered from headaches, toothaches and illnesses, a sign apparently of bad relations, or something more sinister to come. So far, the focus of Nicholas is the economy. The Trans-Siberian railway is one of the largest logistical and industrial projects for Russia to date, and the enactment of the gold-standard in 1897 saw what was the idea of a firm and stable Russian economy. So far uneventful and uninspiring, it looks to be Nicholas' reign will be one without disturbance and one without distribution. If it wasn't only for the consistent bad omens and misfortune plaguing his rule, it would seem everything is going fine..."

His father, Alfonso XII, had died just a year earlier in Novemember 1985. Under his mother's regency Alfonso has seen the hold Spain had over Asia and America disappear after Spain's humiliating defeat in the Spanish-American war of 1898, losing Spain's rule over Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines to the United States, forcing Alfonso and the Primer Ministro to focus development on Spain and whatever small colonies Spain has in Africa."
