 KOR_great_game:0 "Great Game"
 KOR_great_game:0 "Korea is in a valley between great powers, all brutally vying for control over her homeland. Russia, Japan, China, and the West all pry at her like vultures at a carcass. The dangerous overlapping claims on the empire will surely be her undoing, if not dealt with swiftly. With the establishment of the Chukhwabi, Korea has staved off the western powers. This does not mean she is safe, however. Japan and Russia are currently butting heads over the peninsula, paying no credence to China’s claim, although her ability to stake it is questionable. The treaty of Ganghwa island has allowed Japan to “modernize” Korea, but so far it seems to be a ploy to exert influence. The “A Gwan Pa Cheon” incident with Russia has also increased tensions with the giant to our north. Without action, Korea is a staging ground for a great struggle, all to swallow the tiger whole, with not even an objection out of her. The great powers would have us shut up and sit down to bow to their whims, but if we maneuver ourselves cunningly, and stand up to those who would have us eaten, we may survive yet."
 KOR_gwangmu_reform:0 "Gwangmu Reform"
 KOR_gwangmu_reform_desc:0 "Despite limited knowledge of this outside of Korea itself, the Korean imperial family has pursued independent reforms akin to that of the Meiji restoration to further strengthen the state. Government funded schools, banks and railroads have all been greenlit under the constitution, heavily influenced by Emperor Gojong’s visit to Russia in 1897 including all the rituals and circumstances held with it. The reforms, however optimistic they are, have been under threat lately due to Koreans' questionable independence and opposition from the likes of the Japanese and conservatives in the government. Not only that, but the budget is extremely inflated with the expansion of the military. Time will tell if Korea can continue its reforms, hoping to seat itself as a modern and functioning bureaucracy."
