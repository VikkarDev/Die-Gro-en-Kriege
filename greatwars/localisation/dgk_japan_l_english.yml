# FOCUS TREE
########### 1900-1914 Focus Tree Localisation ###########
JAP_the_manchurian_crisis:0 "The Manchurian Crisis"
JAP_the_manchurian_crisis_desc:0 "Northern China has always been the powderkeg of Asia. Uprisings, rebellions, and conflict seems to be commonplace. Currently, there is a dangerous overlap of spheres of influence and claims between our government and Russia. The Russian government, hoping to strongman their way into Chinese affairs, has struck a deal with the Chinese for ownership of Railways in the region, giving them De Facto control over the entire area. This, is in stark contrast to our annexation of the region in 1888, which was so brutally cut down and denied to us by the European powers. We must act decisively to solve this crisis, or else potentially face dire consequences."
JAP_protest_russian_deployment:0 "Protest Russian Deployment"
JAP_protest_russian_deployment_desc:0 "Russia already claims a hegenomy over Eastern Europe. We cannot allow Western Imperialism to expand into Asia. By taking a strong and defiant stance, we might hope to withdraw their interests and show them we are not just another Asian minor power. If they persist, we have other solutions in mind."
JAP_alliance_with_britain:0 "Alliance with Japan"
JAP_alliance_with_britain_desc:0 "A war with Russia, within our military command, is currently beyond inconcievable. It brings risk of western intervention, and a fate similar to China's during the Opium wars. By Aligning ourselves with a like-minded Western power containing similar motivations in positioning against Russia, we can give ourselves total freedom of movement within the Asian sphere."
JAP_military_intervention:0 "Military Intervention"
JAP_military_intervention_desc:0 "Russia's seat of power is over 6,000 kilometres from Manchuria. We are but 1/6 of that. We have a distinct advantage in the field but only if we strike fast and hard. We must secure Manchuria, for the glory of the Emperor. Tenno Hekai, Banzai!"
JAP_the_unthinkable_victory:0 "The Unthinkable Victory"
JAP_the_unthinkable_victory_desc:0 "Japan has become the first ever Asian power to defeat a Western one in the field. We have secured our destiny in Asia, and forged a powerful alliance with it. Our position stands at the top of the Asian Heirarchy, and now we can reap what was thought to be an unthinkable victory!"
JAP_assert_our_dominance:0 "Assert our Dominance"
JAP_assert_our_dominance_desc:0 "With hegonomy over Northern China realised, we now must decide on our course of action in order to split the territories once warred over. While Manchuria has always been rightful Chinese territory, this newfound victory presents opportunities to seize valuable land from the crumbling Qing Empire."
JAP_repurpose_russian_ports:0 "Repurpose Russian Ports"
JAP_repurpose_russian_ports_desc:0 "Port Arthur was to the Russians simply a port that gives them access to warm waters. For us, this is no issue. We can repurpose the port's existing infastructure to better suit our needs of shipbuilding and production."
JAP_the_manchurian_question:0 "The Manchurian Question"
JAP_the_manchurian_question_desc:0 "With southern Manchuria firmly within our sphere of influence, it might be more benificial to set up a temporary Chinese puppet state, in order to better deal with Chinese bandits and local administration."
JAP_befriend_western_powers:0 "Befriend Western Powers"
JAP_befriend_western_powers_desc:0 "We have shown our best side to the world, and the reaction abroad is one of surprise, and often contempt. If we reach out arms of friendship and goodwill, we can hope to prevent any backlash and allow us to continue our efforts unaposed by other European powers."
JAP_honorable_defeat:0 "Honorable Defeat"
JAP_honorable_defeat_desc:0 "The Russian might has proven too great for the will of our soldiers. Looking for an honorable peace, we have ceded our expansion in Manchuria in order to keep our holdings in Korea. Luckily for us, our people were not expecting victory. The ramifications back home are not severe."
JAP_lick_our_wounds:0 "Lick our Wounds"
JAP_lick_our_wounds_desc:0 "We cannot afford to be defeated in such manner again in the future, or face being carved up like any other nation under the European boot. Immediate strengthening of the military is required, and our people must know their duty to the state of Japan."
JAP_strengthen_japanese_hold_on_korea:0 "Strengthen Japanese Hold on Korea"
JAP_strengthen_japanese_hold_on_korea_desc:0 "Korea is our stake, and currently staging ground for mainland Asian affairs. we must utilise the land to the fullest, and ensure our troop holdings there will have the best chance of repelling invasion... or staging one."
JAP_take_a_backseat_in_chinese_affairs:0 "Take a Backseat in Chinese Affairs"
JAP_take_a_backseat_in_chinese_affairs_desc:0 "China has proven that further provocation would lead to the early demise of our Empire. It is not worth it, for now at least, to pursue any more aggressive policies against the region. For now, we must ensure peace and safety through mutual cooperation."
JAP_fortify_korea:0 "Fortify Korea"
JAP_fortify_korea_desc:0 "Despite our recent defeat in the Asian theatre, our extensive holdings in Korea must not falter. In order to safeguard our possessions, extensive fortification and industrial buildup is necessary."
JAP_the_pacific_fleet:0 "The Pacific Fleet"
JAP_the_pacific_fleet_desc:0 "Our fleet in the Pacific faces potentially grand foes. As the western powers have shown us, naval projection is the key to becoming a dominant power. We must realise this on our path to Asian dominance. While our shipbuilding capabilities are small, we can always outsource to European powers who are willing to assist."
JAP_combat_russian_heavy_ships:0 "Combat Russian Heavy Ships"
JAP_combat_russian_heavy_ships_desc:0 "Russia has a large presence of large capital ships in their Pacific docks. There is little we can do to fight them head on, lest we realise our supremacy of the mind, will, and spirit, as well as press an advantage in technology, as their fleets have notably aged in the past decades compared to contemporary ship designs."
JAP_genjo:0 "Genjo"
JAP_genjo_desc:0 "Genjo, or "status quo" is a pervasive idea in Japanese politics. it is often thought that to disturb normality you make yourself a threat, a blade of grass sticking up ready to be cut down. Ever since Meiji's restoration of the Emperor, we have seen untold success and fortune. In order to continue these successes, it is evident that we should not stray from our path in the coming years."

JAP_continue_industrial_build-up_desc:0 "Japan, in the previous decades has seen an astronomical increase in its insustrial capabilities. This does not mean we are a superpower by any means, but the momentum must not be lost. Current industrial expansion blueprints must be greenlighted at a faster pace, with particular emphasis on our construction and extraction capabilities."
JAP_strengthen_the_home_islands:0 "Strengthen the Home Islands"
JAP_strengthen_the_home_islands_desc:0 "Instead of focusing on expansion, we must turn our home islands into a venerable fortress. A massive indsustrial overhaul. This is in no way impossible, as the lack of expansionist drive has allowed a lot of resources to be diverted..."

japan.1.t:0 "Navy Pressure to Emperor About Manchuria"
japan.1.d:0 "As Russian ambitions in the Japanese sphere of influence grow, the navy has suggested that the Empire makes a preemptive strike against the Tsar, as to utilize the element of surprise against the damned Ruskies. While there has been a great deal of bickering between the navy and the army, it is ultimately up to the Emperor himself to decide. A decision that could very much affect the future of the Empire is on the emperor’s desk. Ultimately, he decided to…"
japan.1.a:0 "Declare war immediately. We must strike first!"
japan.1.b:0 "Wait for the Russians. If they want a fight, we will fight, but not otherwise."

japan.3.t:0 "Russian Empire Surrenders"
japan.3.d:0 "After a series of battles in the Liaodong Peninsula resulting in Russian armies being driven from southern Manchiria, and the the Battle of Tsushima had a resulted in a cataclysm for the Imperial Russin Navy, the Russo-Japanese can finally come to an end if you accept Russia's surrender."
japan.3.a:0 "We won, lets accept their surrender."
japan.3.b:0 "The war isn't over yet. Keep fighting!"

japan.4.t:0 "The Manchurian Crisis"
japan.4.d:0 "Manchuria was denied from us once in 1888. Right now, the Russians are attempting their own hegenomy of the region simply unopposed. China has bent the knee to Russian railway manufacturers, and Port Arther is lucratively leased to them. The Chinese lapdogs are no matter to us. Our current military command are at a crossroads. Some, are extremely hesitant. Russia's Pacific Fleet alone outnumbers our surface fleet by multiple capital ships, and Russian ground forces in Manchuria number in the hundreds of thousands. A war it this stage would be idiotic.\n\nHowever, some, including Meiji himself believe that with proper positioning, planning, and through the Samurai spirit, we can defeat the Russian barbarians and push for peace with swift victories. Furthermore, our people itch for a war, with overwhelming support for proving our might in the field, and establishing ourselves as a true dominant power in Asia, which could feasibly be achieved with this opportunity for war."
japan.4.a:0 "Manchuria will be ours."

japan.5.t:0 "Japan Issues Diplomatic Protest!"
japan.5.d:0 "The fledgling state of Japan been attempting their own Asian hegenomy for some time now. Our overlapping claims in Northern China has never really been much of a concern to us. However, Japan seems content in escalating the situation and has issued a protest to our troops rightfully occupying our vital railways in the region. This could easily transform into a dangerious sitation for us, and potentially cause a war in our far east holdings. This would not be ideal, our incomplete infrastructure network and sub-par rail network would greatly hamper any war effort in the region. Japan also fields a powerful navy, one to even challenge ours held at Port Arthur."
japan.5.a:0 "We cannot risk a war!"
japan.5.b:0 "How about maybe YOU chill?!"

japan.6.t:0 "Japanese Cooperation?"
japan.6.d:0 "The Japanese embassy has made an interesting diplomatic move recently. A join mutual alliance, with secret intent to move against Russia. Russian expansion in the East, according to the Japanese ambassador has been "threatening Japanese sovereignty" and is in clear violation of previous treatys they have formed with China. Should we accept, Japan would be free to intervene in Russian expansion, a potentially benificial situation for us in the European balance game."
japan.6.a:0 "Sign the Treaty, Russian Expansion must be stopped."
japan.6.b:0 "We have no time for frivolous Asian affairs."

japan.7.t:0 "Lines Drawn in the Sand"
japan.7.d:0 "With Russia accepting our Korean claim and pulling out of Manchuria, We can now freely decide the fate of the territories we rightfully claim. The Qing government expects us to return lost territories to them, simply accepting our claim in Korea. However, the weak and destitute Qing state would do little to stop Annexations of Port Arthur. Furthurmore, there are those in China who are willing to cooperate with us, with promise of overthrowing the Qing government. This could present an opportunity for a Chinese puppet."
japan.7.a:0 "Simply enforce our rule in Korea."
japan.7.b:0 "Claim Port Arthur."
japan.7.c:0 "Annex the whole region."

japan.8.t:0 "Japan Wishes for Non-Aggression Pact"
japan.8.d:0 "It seems the Japanese nation in light of recent defeats are seeking for a safeguarded peace withour nation, citing a "dangerous and costly development in China" Japan has also taken the opportunity to build up its military presence in Korea as well as develop their military industry, so it might be wise to go along with their plan."

japan.9.a:0 "We do not seek further war with Japan."
japan.9.b:0 "A non agression pact is not within our best interest at the moment."

JAP_meiji_restoration_desc:0 "Long live the great emperor Matsuhito. Restorer of the Japanese imperial power. Japan is now set on a course of a nationalistic and powerful central government, headed by a lineage of men descended from the sun god himself. Some mock or critise us for the absolute powers he holds, but is it not the roots of the Western powers that seeded the idea of absolute monarchy? And was it not those systems that brought them to greatness? Japan shall now take its turn on the world stage, and no one shall stop it."
JAP_bushido_code:0 "Bushido Code"
JAP_bushido_code_desc:0 "The Japanese warrior code, or Bushido is the widespread idea in our army of the samurai primacy, the way of the warrior. the importance of attack, honor, and death before surrender. Japan has long been honing its sense of honor since time immemorium. On the modern stage, it gives her soldiers a sense of fanaticism, the ability to throw themselves into the fray without any sense of hesitation."
JAP_developed_rail_network:0 "Developed Rail Network"
JAP_developed_rail_network_desc:0 "Sakoku, or "closed country" has ended, ever since 1854. Westerm investors took a keen eye on the landscape of Japan, selling and constructing vast railway networks across the home islands, with many of our engineers keenly observing and utilising these machines. Japan since, has rapidly industrialised the likes of which no other eastern country has seen before."
JAP_wooden_constructions:0 "Wooden Constructions"
JAP_wooden_constructions_desc:0 "Spare for a handful of buildings in the largest cities, the majority of constructions in Japan are traditional, wooden and paper buildings providing only protection from the elements. Our engineerial thought still reflects this, with tradition taking precedense over modernisation. We are yet to take advantage of brick or concrete, and our construction ability reflects this."
JAP_kokai_naval_spirit:0 "Kokai Naval Spirit"
JAP_kokai_naval_spirit_desc:0 "Kokai is known as "high seas". Japan has always had its eye on the seas beyond. The sun rises from the great ocean in the east, and sets in the sea of Japan to the west. Instead of sheer firepower and force, Japan can rely on a supreme spirit and will of her sailors, and the conviction of the commanders that guide them."

JAP_HOG_TITLE:0 "Shushō"
JAP_HOS_TITLE:0 "Ten'nō"
JAP_MEIJI:0 "Mutsuhito"
JAP_HIROBUMI_NAME:0 "Hirobumi Ito"
JAP_YAMAGATA_NAME:0 "Yamagata Aritomo"
MEIJI_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "Mutsuhito is only a term found on paper and spoken by foreign lips. In Japan, it is Meiji, better known as Meiji the Great. The great reformer of the land, Meiji has seen what was an isolated medieval country transformed into an industrial powerhouse that has firmly placed itself at the top of the Asian pecking order. For hundreds of years however, the Emperor would not be the person you would see causing change or facilitating its creation. This role was given to the Shogun. The Emperor did not have the power, influence, or army to do much more than even step outside of the grand palace. Meiji found himself at an opportune time, being born in 1852, only a year before Japan was strongarmed by Matthew Perry into opening the country to foreigners. More a cause of situation rather than action, the young Mutsuhito saw constant conflict as Japan engulfed itself in destructive civil war as Daimyos and local lords fought eachother for ideological primacy and the overthrow of an ever-incompetant Shogunate. The next in line for the Imperial throne, Mutsuhito was ordaned into the Meiji era in 1867 at the age of 16 to the Chrysanthemum throne. Just one year later, seeking to restore what was a patchwork government after vast power vacuums had formed following the overthrow of the Shogunate, Meiji proclamed the grand restoration, later known as the Meiji Restoration, restoring power back into the hands of the Emperor, with an elected constitutional government taking the role of what once was the Daimyos. Physically enscribing notes from western style parliaments, the Meiji Constitution has seen the rapid bureaucratic, industrial, logistical and social development of Japan into something strikingly uncanny to any western nation, with a well-equipped army to boot. With the day-to-day governing largely returned to the hands of the Parliament, Meiji has largely returned to the role of a figurehead. However, there remains no doubt to the theoretical power that he holds, written firmly in the Meiji constitution."
HIROBUMI_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "Hirobumi Ito is a career politician through and through. The first, sixth, eightth and now eleventh prime minister of Japan, Hirobumi has so far served for 7 years as Japan's Prime Minister. For context, the Prime Ministerial role has only existed for 14 years. Hirobumi was born into a prominent samurai clan in 1841, when Japan was still feudally ruled by lords and warriors. Being only a boy when Japan opened itself to the outside world, Hirobumi became fascinated with European culture as well as how Japan relates to the world around it. He attended University in London, learning English, but most importantly learning of the western constitutions and systems of government. Being highly educated, Hirobumi was prime candidate for ministerial positions when the Meiji restoration rolled around in 1868. He was appointed governor of Hyogo Prefecture the same year as well as the role of a junior councillor for foreign affairs. Striking his name on every position ballot, Hirobumi pushed for a further study of western systems, as well as an aggressive and strong foreign policy despite his low ranking positions at the time. Visiting many foreign countries in his early years, Hirobumi climbed the ranks of the early Meiji government, and eventually found himself as the chairman of the Bureau of the Constitution, which penned the official Meiji Constitution. His time overseas served him greatly, and he used his knowledge of foreign governments, notably German, British and French, to model an entirely new system of governance, with Meiji as the sole head and ruler of Japan as is fitting, with him, as its first Prime Minister in 1885. Ambitious as it comes, Hirobumi saw many conflicts involving Japan, especially pushing for the heavily favourable treaty between Japan and China after the first Sjno-Japanese war. With Hirobumi serving his fourth term, only time will tell if his generally ambitious and dominating plans will bear fruit once again."
YAMAGATA_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "Being a prominent member of the Genro, the ruling elite during the Meiji restoration, Yamagata is a man that commands high respect from his peers. A key player in the crushing of the Satsuma rebellion, and staunch supporter of Meiji, Yamagata’s political pandering and subsequent connections garnered him a place at the top when Japan ultimately united under Meiji. Yamagata’s samurai lineage however did little to help his position, as his clan was plagued with low-standing and little respect from fellow clans. It was purely by his political positionings that worked to his advantage. Yamagata was an early member in the underground movement to overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate, and thus used the Imperial victories to weave his place in political positions. Being selected as one of the first members of Japanese politics to study foreign militaries, Yamagata learned valuable lessons about war doctrine. He became what was known as the ruling military elite. Often, in Japan, men of high military rank would also occupy high ranking political positions, further leading to the militarisation of the Japanese society. Yamagata’s talent for military affairs granted him a large following of officers, and he used this following to occupy many diverse and elite political positions throughout the 1880s and 1890s. Ministerial, legislative, and presidential positions are all under Yamagata’s belt, as well as previous experience as Prime Minister. Arguably the most powerful man in Japan, bar only Meiji himself, Yamagata is destined for continued successes. This does not mean he is without rivals, but his extreme respect, honour, and militarised position means his power is relatively safe. Some argue that a man of the military leading Japan will lead it down the path of war, Yamagata argues that this is simply the way of Japan, and has been for hundreds of years."
