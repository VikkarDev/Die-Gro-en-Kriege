# Naval Arms Race (Britain)
dgk_britain_naval_race_category:0 "Anglo-German Naval Arms Race"
dgk_britain_naval_race_category_desc:0 "As a naval arms race has broken out between us and Germany, we must strengthen our naval capabilities in order to match the German Kaiserliche Marine. While at the moment we have the advantage over the Germans, that could very well change at any moment - we must stay on high alert. The further development of our navy, including new and better ships, better strategies, and the likes, will improve our situation in this new naval arms race."

britain_naval.1.d:0 "The time has come again for us to appoint a new First Sea Lord, as the current incompetent First Sea Lord has been removed for his bad strategy, although of course the official statement was that we needed fresh minds in British naval strategy and production. In the ongoing naval arms race with Germany, we need a clear strategy and clear priorities. The decision of who to appoint as First Sea Lord is a decision that will impact our strategy and priorities for years to come. Our options are John Fisher, who prioritizes the development of new types of ships that will render the German ones outdated, Arthur Wilson, who prioritizes producing and deploying as many ships as possible, and Francis Bridgeman, a staunch traditionalist who prioritizes maintaining traditions in the navy and winning the naval arms race through prestige. The choice is yours."
