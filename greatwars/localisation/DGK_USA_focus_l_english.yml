USA_gilded_age:0 "The Gilded Age"
USA_gilded_age_desc:0 "It is the golden age of the United States. With the reconstruction finally ending in the 1870's the USA could finally spread its wings and launch into the new century. At no time in history has the country experienced a period of more rapid economic growth and development than now. Fortunes are made, gambled, and lost in the span of a few years, and the boom has fueled innovation and the emergence of the first American global corporations. Things in the east are booming, as names like John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and J. P. Morgan rule the day. However, not all is as it seems on the surface..."
USA_jeffersons_vision:0 "Jefferson's Vision"
USA_jeffersons_vision_desc:0 "At the very founding of the United States there was a great disagreement about what the ideal American society would look like. Alexander Hamilton and his Federalist Party envisioned an America of industrial might, large cities, and great material wealth. On the contrary, men like Thomas Jefferson envisioned a nation of farmers—each man owning his own land, eating his own food, controlling his own destiny, and living together in harmony with others. It is clear that Hamilton's ideas have ruled the day, but at what cost? Only one thing can save this nation from itself—and that is a return to the America that Jefferson once had in mind."
USA_corporate_primacy:0 "Corporate Primacy"
USA_corporate_primacy_desc:0 "Who needs 'small businesses' when you have the option for even BIGGER businesses? Corporate power is what will propel the United States into first on the world stage. If a few farmers and shopkeepers get hurt along the way, so be it."
USA_continue_subsidies:0 "Continue the Subsidies"
USA_continue_subsidies_desc:0 "Since the early days of this country our government has always seen fit to help out various key industries in the nation, be it agricultural or industrial. Oftentimes this comes in the form of tariffs to protect national goods, but sometimes it also comes in the form of direct subsidies or contracts to businesses. If we want to sustain the rapid growth of our industry, the govenrment must step in and help out."
USA_favorable_business_reg:0 "Favorable Business Regulations"
USA_favorable_business_reg_desc:0 "If we want our businesses to continue to grow and prosper, we must make sure that we're cutting down on the bureaucratic red tape within our government. Businesses need a healthy market to thrive and grow in, and we must make sure to provide that."
USA_ignore_monopolization:0 "Ignore Monopolization"
USA_ignore_monopolization_desc:0 "Political economists have long lampooned the idea of a monopoly company in a market as 'anti-competative' and bad for business. While this may be true in their theories, it surely won't materialize in practice. Any monopolies which arise in our nation form simply because they're the best, and if we're getting our share of the profits, what harm can it do?"
USA_true_free_market:0 "A Truly Free Market"
USA_true_free_market_desc:0 "Despite the success of our businesses, one cannot turn a blind eye to the problem of monopolization in our markets. We cannot afford to have important industries like steel, coal, railroads, and oil controlled by a singular entity. The time has ccome to take a stand against these behemoths and put an end to their domination."
USA_enforce_sherman_act:0 "Enforce the Sherman Act"
USA_enforce_sherman_act_desc:0 "The Sherman Antitrust act of 1890 was the first federal law designed to prevent the formation of trusts—large conglomerations of businesses consolidated together for the purpose of promoting a unified policy over a market—but it has largely been ignored and unenforced by the government. The act provides us with the necessary tools to break up the trusts, but doing so would doubtless anger the magnates..."
USA_anti_monopoly_hearings:0 "Anti-Monopoly Hearings"
USA_anti_monopoly_hearings_desc:0 "Now that we've decided to embrace Congress' responsibility to dismantle monopolies under the Sherman Act we must hold hearings for various companies which fit the definitions of anticompetative under the act. With this, we can bring fair competition to our markets—or eliminate those who won't support us..."
USA_fair_competition:0 "Fair Competition"
USA_fair_competition_desc:0 "Now that the monopolies have been curtailed we can finally embrace the free market ideals that America was founded upon. We are truly a land of freedom, fairness, and opportunity."
USA_encourage_vertical_integration:0 "Encourage Vertical Integration"
USA_encourage_vertical_integration_desc:0 "The idea of 'free and fair competition' is highly overrated in this country. The government shouldn't be trying to hinder the practices of our lagre businesses—quite the opposite! We should instead encourage the consolidation of industrial sectors and we will all reap the profits."
USA_consolidate_sectors:0 "Consolidate Sectors"
USA_consolidate_sectors_desc:0 "As it is the role of the government to facilitate the national economy, it should also fall within our purview to manage certain sectors as the public good requires. Closer cooperation between businesses and government is needed, and introducing legislation to centralize some sectors will help this process along."
USA_sponsored_industrialization:0 "State-Sponsored Industrialization"
USA_sponsored_industrialization_desc:0 "If we wish to ever be on the economic level of the nations of Europe then the government must continue to take an active role in investing in the industrialization of our economy. We may be ahead in the race right now, but we must make sure the United States always remains on top of global manufacturing and production."
USA_continue_laissez_faire:0 "Continue "Laissez Faire""
USA_continue_laissez_faire_desc:0 "Our current economic policies of minimal intervention have given us great prosperity. Although we don't fully embrace the aforementioned idea of Adam Smith, the American System has shown to be successful and thus needs no change."
USA_continue_protectionism:0 "Continue Protectionist Policies"
USA_continue_protectionism_desc:0 "Protectionism has served as a cornerstone of the American economy nearly since its inception. It has facilitated the rapid growth of our domestic industry and protected from foreign dumping of goods. Tried and tested, this practice will continue to form the bedrock of our trade policy."
USA_gold_question:0 "The Gold Question"
USA_gold_question_desc:0 "There has recently been increasing skepticism thoughout the nation about the benefits of the Gold Standard—a system which has long laid at the very foundation of the US economy. Perhaps it is time we re-evaluate the benefits of such a system and open up to the arguments of the other side."
USA_gold_standard_act:0 "The Gold Standard Act"
USA_gold_standard_act_desc:0 "The introduction of the Gold Standard Act will give our nation the chance to say once and for all which path we choose for our financial future. Should the act succeed, we can expect more of the same, but it is uncertain what may happen should it fail..."
USA_gold_stay_course:0 "Stay the Course"
USA_gold_stay_course_desc:0 "The passage of the Gold Standard Act has once again solidified the financial policy of this nation. With a hard and stable backing to our currency we can continue our rapid growth and development."
USA_fiduciary_responsibility:0 "Fiduciary Responsibility"
USA_fiduciary_responsibility_desc:0 "There is no question that the upholding of the Gold Standard has ensured vigilance on the part of the govenrment dealing with finances. If we are to make sure our policies are sound, we must continue to place emphasis on fiduciary responsiblity. A sound currency makes for a sound economy!"
USA_central_banking_question:0 "The Question of Central Banking"
USA_central_banking_question_desc:0 "Ever since the Veto of the Second Bank of the United States by Andrew Jackson the country has proceeded without a centralized institution for lending, issuing credit, or treasury notes. However, we must carefully examine whether such a policy has been a good choice for our nation, and if not; take action to change course."
USA_bimetallism:0 "Bimetallism"
USA_bimetallism_desc:0 "The failure of the Gold Standard Act has cast doubt about the future of the dollar's backing. Fortunately, a solution has presented itself. Rather than a single metal—gold—acting as our backer, we shall have both gold and silver. This will allow the value of our dollar to depreciate just enough to satisfy the wants of businessmen in the east and farmers in the west."
USA_america_silver_slippers:0 "America's Silver Slippers"
USA_america_silver_slippers_desc:0 "With free silver now ruling the day, America can finally put her silver slippers on and the currency trouble behind us."
USA_devalue_dollar:0 "Devalue the Dollar"
USA_devalue_dollar_desc:0 "It's become a nightmare in this nation to be someone with debt! The Gold Standard kept the working class constantly trapped in a vicious cycle of deflation, with debt being nearly impossible to pay back. With it gone, we can finally give the dollar a much needed devaluation and allow economic prosperity to reach the lower classes."
USA_higher_man_tariffs:0 "Raise Manufacturing Tariffs"
