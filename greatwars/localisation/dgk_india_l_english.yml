#RAJ_invite_british_investors_desc:0 "To expand our factories and resources we still heavily rely on British capital. Until we have a vigorous banking sector of our own, we must go on bended knee to London to seek support."
RAJ_expand_the_national_congress:0 "Expand the National Congress"
RAJ_expand_the_national_congress_desc:0 "In 1885, the Indian National Congress was created so that Indians could get a greater say in how the British would govern them. If the National Congress is expanded and supported, hopefully Britain will offer India some autonomy and freedom."
RAJ_oppose_the_british:0 "Oppose the British"
RAJ_oppose_the_british_desc:0 "Locals must do everything to try and fight against the British rule. We do not want them in India, for India should be a free country ruled by Indians, not by foreigners."
RAJ_accept_the_british:0 "Accept the British"
RAJ_accept_the_british_desc:0 "We should accept the British rule. They are too powerful for us to fight against them, and perhaps allowing the British into our lands could help our economy. Not only that, but we need Britain's naval power to protect us from foreign threats looking to conquer and steal our resources."
