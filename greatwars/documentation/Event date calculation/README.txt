Events with a mean time to happen build up and create a not-small amount of lag. A large portion of such events in EoaNB are just events that are supposed to fire near a specific date.
It is way better to, instead, fire it on startup in a specific amount of days. It still allows you to fire around a specific date in a range of days too.
The events are put to trigger in common/on_actions/on_startup_events.txt as to not clutter the other files. 
It is still possible to not make it always trigger by leaving in trigger = {} and just putting is_triggered_only = yes and removing the date check from the trigger.

The scripts are to be opened in Python 3. You can download it in https://www.python.org/downloads/, where you can select any version beginning with 3.

Event_date_calculation.py allows you to easily calculate the amount of days between each start date and the event.
To speed the progress up, just pressing enter without entering a number in the range prompt will assume a range of 100 days.

Reverse_date_calculation.py does the reverse - Given the start date and the amount of days, it allows you to get the end date.
